# Poker Hand Calculator

This project shows a randomly generated hand calculator from a deck of cards.
Internally, you are ready to deploy new players and compare your scores to determine the winner in each hand. Also, a table of possible winning hands is attached along with the score they provide and the probability that this hand will be generated.
